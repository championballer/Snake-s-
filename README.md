# Snakes
A simple snake game written in python using curses and random libraries. This game (in hopefully, a more complex format) is meant to act as the base simulator for the 7th Semester Project of Competitive Self Play and Skills based transfer learning. The algorithms to be tested range from PPO to MADDPG. The environment will also be improved to support better visualisations and multi-snake games to see how they cooperate or compete. 


## How to play

Just run the snake.py file in the terminal.
