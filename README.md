# Snakes
A simple snake game written in python using curses and random libraries. This game (in hopefully, a more complex format) is meant to act as the base simulator for the 7th Semester Project of Competitive Self Play and Skills based transfer learning. 


## How to play

Just run the snake.py file in the terminal.
